✨✨a personal Ai with a long-term memory ✨✨
 
this project is a fork of [longTermMemo...](#@longTermMemo...) which i tought between all of the hypes of making a big models , needed a little more attention.
we already have models out there that have better reaoning than humans. so to make the epoclypse happens faster, he gave them a long-term memory.

my only problem with the [davidShap](#@davidShap)project was using a big model like gpt3 ,which wont show the real effect of long-term memory and additional-data because they already can predict all kinds of senarios under the hood.

<!-- 
so in this project i intentionally used small models which not only shows us how we are improving the model undrestanding but also gives us benefit of privacy and decentralazation(you can run this in a 8core cpu) 
 -->

## so in short why i made this project: 

- test how much we can improve context-awareness of a small model

- convert it to TS(Deno)
    - i belive if all of ML tools were developed around js(with its massive comminuty) ,instead of a having new frontend NPM package each day,we'd be making gpt10 while gpt9 was funding us.

- a personal chatgpt-like assistant:
    - you can replace model(current model can be run on a 8-core cpu )
    - in order to have a real Ai assistant, we have to give all of our personal details to the model , so can you trust big companies!?

- boring holidays:
    - cure my infinit bordom while practicing prompt enginiering and testing new chatgpt like Ais to work on a languages like python that i have almost 0.1% knowledge compared to Ts.
