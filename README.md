✨✨a personal Ai with long-term memory ✨✨

this project is a fork of [LongtermChatExternalSources](#@https://github.com/daveshap/LongtermChatExternalSources.git)which I thought between all of the hypes of making big models, needed a little more attention. we already have models out there that have better reasoning than humans. so to make the apocalypse happens faster, he gave them a long-term memory.
My only problem with the [David Shapiro](#@https://github.com/daveshap) project was using a big model like gpt3, which won't show the real effect of long-term memory and additional data because they already can predict all kinds of scenarios under the hood.


## so in short why I made this project: 

- test how much we can improve context-awareness of a small model

- convert it to TS(Deno)
    - I believe if all of the ML tools were developed around js(with its massive community), instead of a having new frontend NPM package each day, we'd be making gpt10 while gpt9 was funding us.

- a personal chatgpt-like assistant:
    - you can replace model(current model can be run on a 8-core CPU )
    - in order to have a real Ai assistant, we have to give all of our personal details to the model, so can you trust big companies!?

- boring holidays:
    -to cure my infinite boredom while practicing prompt engineering and testing new chatgpt like Ais to work on languages like Python that I have almost 0.1% knowledge of compared to Ts.
